# Symbolic Math

Well it once was about the collatz conjecture but then we got off topic and now its about processing symbolic math.

Currently only supports calculations with integers, and only summation and subtraction.

Example: `-7 + x + 10` will turn into `3 + x`

How to run:
- Clone project
- run `make` in the folder
- run `./main`
